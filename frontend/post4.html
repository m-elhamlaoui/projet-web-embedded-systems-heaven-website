        <h2><span class="highlight">What is Machine Learning?</span> </h2>
        <p>
            A subset of the field of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning is a discipline focused on using mathematical techniques 
            and large-scale data processing to build programs that can find relationships between input and output data. As an umbrella term,
            AI covers a broad domain in computer science focused on enabling machines to “think” and act without human intervention. It covers
            everything from “general intelligence” or the ability for a machine to think and act in the same way a human would, to specialized,
            task-oriented intelligence, which is where ML falls on the spectrum.
            One of the most powerful ways that I’ve heard ML defined in the past is in comparison to the traditional, algorithmic approach used 
            in classical computer programming. In classical computing, an engineer presents a computer with input data—for example, the numbers 
            2 and 4—as well as an algorithm for converting them into a needed output—for example, multiply x and y to make z. As a program runs,
            inputs are provided, and the algorithm is applied to produce outputs. This can be seen in Figure 1.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/ml.jpg" alt="algorithm 1">
            <p class="image-caption">Figure 1. In a classic approach, we supply a computer with input data and the algorithm and ask for an answer</p>
        </div>
        <p>
            ML, on the other hand, is the process of presenting a computer with a set of inputs and outputs and asking the computer to identify 
            the “algorithm”—or model, using ML parlance—that turns those inputs into outputs every time. Often, this requires a lot of inputs to 
            ensure the model will properly identify the correct output every time.
            For example, in Figure 2, if I feed an ML system the numbers 2 and 2 and an expected output of 4, it might decide that the algorithm is
            to always add the two numbers together. But if I then provide the numbers 2 and 4 and the expected output of 8, the model will learn from
            two examples that the correct approach is to multiply the two provided numbers.
        </p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="images/ml1.jpg" alt="algorithm 2">
            <p class="image-caption">Figure 2. With ML, we have the data (inputs) and answers (output) and need the computer to derive an
                 algorithm of sorts by determining how the inputs and outputs relate in a way that is true for the entire data set.</p>
        </div>
        <h2><span class="highlight">Machine Learning Model Development, Training, Testing, Refining</span> </h2>
        <p>
            After data collection, the next steps are model development, training, testing, and refinement. This phase is where a data scientist
            or engineer creates a program that ingests the mass of collected input data and transforms it into the expected outputs using one or
            more approaches. Explaining those approaches could fill volumes, but suffice it to say that most models perform a set of 
            transformations (for example, vector and matrix multiplication) on their inputs. Additionally, they will adjust the weights of each
            and every input against each other in order to find a set of weights and functions that reliably correlate to the expected outputs
            This phase of the process is often iterative. The engineer will adjust the model, the tools, and methods used, as well as the number 
            of iterations to run during model training and other parameters to build something that reliably can correlate the input data to the 
            correct outputs (aka, the labels). Once the engineer is happy with this correlation, they test the model using inputs not used in 
            training to see how the model performs on unknown data. If the model underperforms on this new data, the engineer repeats the loop,
            shown in Figure 4, and refines the model further.

        <h2><span class="highlight">So Where Does TinyML Fit?</span></h2>
        <p>
            If it’s not clear already, machine learning is a data-intensive process. When you are attempting to derive a model through correlation
            you need a lot of data to feed that model. Hundreds of images or thousands of sensor readings. In fact, the process of model training
            is so intensive, and so specialized, that it’s a resource hog for almost any central processing unit (CPU), no matter how 
            high-powered. Instead, the vector and matrix-math operations so common in ML are not dissimilar from graphics processing applications,
            which is why GPUs have become such a popular choice for model development.
            Given the need for powerful compute, the cloud has become the de-facto place to offload the work of training models and hosting them 
            for real-time prediction. While model training is, and remains the domain of the cloud, especially for embedded and IoT applications,
            the closer we can move our ability to make real-time predictions to the place where data is captured, the better our systems will be.
            We get the benefit of built-in security and low latency when running models on microcontrollers, as well as the ability to make 
            decisions and take action in a local environment, without relying on an internet connection to do so.
            This is the domain of TinyML, where platform companies like Edge Impulse are building cloud-based tools for sensor data collection and 
            ML architectures that output compact, efficient models purpose-built for microcontroller units (MCUs). Where an increasing number of 
            silicon vendors, from STMicroelectronics to Alif Semiconductor are building chips with GPU-like compute capabilities that make them
            perfect for running ML workloads alongside your sensors, right where data is collected.
            For embedded and IoT engineers, there’s never been a better time to explore the world of machine learning, from the cloud to the 
            tiniest of devices. Our systems are only growing more complex and processing more data than ever. Bringing ML to the edge means we can
            deal with that data and make decisions even faster.
