            Embedded systems are specialized computing systems designed to
            perform dedicated functions within larger mechanical or electronic
            systems. Unlike general-purpose computers, which can run a variety
            of applications, embedded systems are tailored for specific tasks
            and often operate under real-time constraints. They are
            characterized by their dedicated functionality, integration with
            hardware, and efficiency in resource-constrained environments.
            Common examples of embedded systems include consumer electronics
            like smartphones and smart TVs, automotive systems such as engine
            control units and anti-lock braking systems, industrial automation
            tools like programmable logic controllers, home appliances such as
            washing machines and smart thermostats, and medical devices
            including pacemakers and infusion pumps. The development process
            involves design, prototyping, programming, testing, and optimization
            to ensure reliability and performance. Embedded systems play a
            crucial role in modern technology, providing control, automation,
            and intelligence across a wide range of applications.

          <span class="paragraph">
            Embedded systems are vital to modern society, impacting daily life
            and various industries. They power consumer electronics like
            smartphones and smart TVs, enhance automotive systems for better
            performance and safety, and are crucial in medical devices improving
            patient care. In industrial automation, they increase efficiency and
            safety, while in telecommunications, they ensure reliable
            communication. Embedded systems also play key roles in energy
            management, environmental monitoring, and the Internet of Things
            (IoT), enabling smart grids, data collection, and connected devices.
            Additionally, they are essential in military technologies for
            national security. Overall, embedded systems drive innovation,
            improve productivity, and foster technological advancements, shaping
            the future of our world.

        <h2><span class="highlight">How do embedded systems work?</span></h2>
        <p>
          Embedded systems are computers. Therefore, like most other computers,
          they contain a combination of hardware and software such as
          microprocessors, microcontrollers, volatile and non-volatile memory,
          graphics processing units (GPUs), input/output communication
          interfaces and ports, power supplies, and system and application code.
          However, embedded systems have four main factors that differentiate
          them from a typical workstation or server: purpose, design, cost, and
          human involvement. Like any other computer, embedded systems leverage
          printed circuit boards (PCBs) programmed with software that guides the
          hardware on operation and data management using memory and input/output
          communication interfaces. The result is the terminal production of
          output that is of value to the end user. As such, at a fundamental
          level, embedded systems are not too different from workstations and
          servers.

        <h2><span class="highlight">Types of embedded systems</span></h2>
        <p>
          When considering performance and functional requirements, embedded
          systems are categorized into real-time embedded systems, standalone
          embedded systems, networked embedded systems, and mobile embedded
          systems.
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
          <li>
            <span class="highlight">Real-time embedded systems</span> prioritize prompt
            output generation and can be classified as soft real-time (lenient
            deadlines) or hard real-time (strict deadlines).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight">Standalone embedded systems</span> can function
            independently without a host computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight">Networked embedded systems</span> rely on network
            connections and communication for output generation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="highlight">Mobile embedded systems</span> refer to small,
            portable devices such as smartphones and laptops.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Finally, when classified based on microcontroller performance, embedded
        systems are divided into small-scale, medium-scale, and sophisticated
        categories, depending on the bit size of the microcontroller.
