 We tried, in this web development project, to create a blog site on embedded systems, covering various interesting articles on everything related to electronics, IoT, and embedded firmware/software. We were inspired by an existing HTML-CSS work (project 9 on https://github.com/anshuopinion/10-Practice-Project-Html-CSS) and added and implemented several concepts learned in the course, such as lists, tables, and the implementation of several internal and external links to make the site more accessible. We also added different articles to properly grasp the principles of writing in HTML.

On the CSS side, we tried to make the site as simple as possible while maintaining a professional look, working on alignments, colors, and creating new pages with HTML and CSS for adding articles. Regarding JavaScript, we tried to make the article addition page more interactive by adding several features for all pages, such as smooth scrolling, sliders, dark mode, lightboxes for images, interactive diagrams, and layout adjustments to keep the site consistent across all devices, even after minimization. We also added a page containing several commonly used tools in embedded systems, such as conversions and calculations in the field of electronics.

Additionally, all these JavaScript methods are accompanied by CSS code, such as the dark mode CSS code, the scrollbar code, etc.

For the back-end part, we used Node.js and MongoDB to add an option allowing visitors passionate about this field to add their articles, which can then be edited or deleted. These articles are stored in our database.
